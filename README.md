# AR-Environment-Skeleton

Active Record creates all methods for our key values that initiatied with (i.e. first_name, last_name, grade_level, teacher_id for our Student class, and last_name, grade_level, and years_of_experience for our Teacher class). Also creates the .all method. Had to create #tenures as well as #full_name and .all_in_grade(grade)

You can use this repo to build new Activerecord projects
